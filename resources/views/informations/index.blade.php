            <p>
                LoyaltyCard is a fake-project website, created solely for the purpose of enhancing my portfolio and honing my web development skills.
                You can use all the functionality that this website can offer you, but I recommend you to not base your fidelity card program on this site.
                Instead, you can try to create program/web-app (like this) using the APIs of this website.

            <h2 id="price">Price</h2>
            <p>
                Being a fake-project the prices are fake and only used to make the website more realistic. That's mean you can subscribe to all plan
                without paying a cent!

            <h2 id="using-data">Using of data</h2>
            <p>
                This website will not use your data (like email, phone number, etc...). You can obviously provide fake data during your subscription: this website
                will never send to any account a mail (neither the correct subscription mail).
                If you want to provide your persona email, remember that the password are protected with Laravel hash.
